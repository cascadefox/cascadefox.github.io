This theme was known previously as »*ag.proton*« — but let's be honest: That sounds hella boring. What you get is a really simple adaptive layout that works well with the new Proton UI. By default — on larger screen resolutions – Cascade will transition to a Oneline layout which displays the URL Bar and Tab Bar next to each other. Smaller resultions will stack both UI elements on top of each other for better readability.
